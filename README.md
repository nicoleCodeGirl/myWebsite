===================================================

The site is in progress, but these are the issues I need some collaboration with. 

(1) Should I put the GitHub card and the LinkedIn card down below with the other social media cards? I have them separated because LinkedIn and GitHub are for coding, and the others are for my beaded jewlery business.

(2) For the (fb. IG, TT) profile cards, they use custom css to make them overlap eachother and transition. I need this to look good on smaller devices too. Should I use flexbox? Bootstrap? Etc? What ever I use, I still want them to ease-out when you hover over them. 

(3)I know I need to fix margins, but if you see anything else that needs to be fixed please let me know. 

You can either messsage me at the email above, or on any of the profiles on my site. You can also play around with it on your own local branch and I'll review any edits you make.

Thank you!
