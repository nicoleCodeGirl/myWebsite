### :purple_heart: Hello! I am NicoleCodeGirl! :purple_heart:

I have been studying web development for over 6 years. I used my skills to make a personal website for my beaded jewelry business. 

### ===================================================

The site is in progress, but these are the issues I need some collaboration with. 

(1) Should I put the GitHub card and the LinkedIn card down below with the other social media cards? I have them separated because LinkedIn and GitHub are for coding, and the others are for my beaded jewlery business.

(2) For the (FB. IG, TT) profile cards, they use custom css to make them overlap eachother and transition. I need this to look good on smaller devices too. Should I use flexbox? Bootstrap? Etc? What ever I use, I still want them to ease-out when you hover over them. 

(3)I know I need to fix margins, but if you see anything else that needs to be fixed please let me know.

Thank you! ðŸ˜ƒ
