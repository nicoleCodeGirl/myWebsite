### :purple_heart: Hello! I am NicoleCodeGirl! :purple_heart:

I have been studying web development for over 6 years. I used my skills to make a personal website for my beaded jewelry business. 

### ===================================================

The site is in progress, but these are the issues I need some collaboration with. 

(1) I designed the site MOBILE first.

(2) I'm still having overflow problems though, and I need help figuring out what the issue is.

(3)If you see anything else that needs to be fixed, or if you think I should add anything,please let me know. I appreciate feedback. 

You can contact me at:

Thank you! ðŸ˜ƒ
