### :purple_heart: Hello! I am NicoleCodeGirl! :purple_heart:

I have been studying web development for over 6 years. I used my skills to make a personal website for my beaded jewelry business. 

### ===================================================

The site is in progress, but these are the issues I need some collaboration with. 

(1) The site is repsonsive for deviceswith the dimensions 320 x 432

(2) I will work on the media queries next so it can be responsive to bigger devices. 
    I am working Mobile First. 

(3)I know I need to fix margins (especially the top margin under the heading), but if you see anything else that needs to be fixed please let me know. 

You can contact me at:

Thank you! ðŸ˜ƒ
